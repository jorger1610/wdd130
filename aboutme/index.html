    <h2>Jorge Romero</h2>
    <h2>Jorgito</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">I am from Aguascalientes Mexico, currently living in Provo Utah. I love many things, I have been putting to much
    work on cycling, hoping to keep growing my category and get into a pro team. I love languages, I'm learning German
    as my thrid language for right now and hopefully do my intership with SIMMONS a robotic-german company. My degree is sofware development,
    and I love to play the piano and the guitar. I am married and I have a beautiful daughter, who now is 2.</p>
